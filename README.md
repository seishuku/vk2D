# vk2D
A simple vulkan framework based on works with my main vulkan engine for doing simple 2D drawing (pixels, lines, circles, etc), such as recreating old-school DOS pixel effects (fire, water, plasma, etc).

Mainly created this, because I had been using the old DirectDraw 7 API, besides being antiquated/disconinued since Windows 7/8, also isn't portable. vk2D will run on Windows, Linux, and should work on Android once I add in support.

The drawing that's ran on this sample is a simple 2D FABRIK (Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics) solver.

There are also other branches that demo other old classic pixel demo effects.
